## Synopsis

Project Instructions:

+ Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.
+ Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly.

## **mtcars** Plot
From the `mtcars` dataset: Weight vs. MPG split by transmission type.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data(mtcars)
library(plotly)

mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am, labels = c("Automatic", "Manual"))
mtcars$car.name <- rownames(mtcars)

plot_ly(mtcars, 
		x = ~wt, 
		y = ~mpg, 
		color = ~factor(am), 
		colors = c("#E00D3B", "#76CDE8"), 
		type = "scatter", 
		mode = "markers",
        size = I(10), 
        text = ~paste(car.name, '<br>Weight: ', wt, 'k pounds', '<br>', mpg, ' MPG', sep = "")) %>%
        layout(xaxis = list(title = "Weight (thousand pounds)"),
               yaxis = list(title = "MPG"), 
               title = "MPG vs. Weight: mtcars dataset")
```
